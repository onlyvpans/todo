# 📝 TODO App

> _Am I even a developer if I don’t have a TODO app on my GitHub?_

Short answer: **no**  
Long answer: **also no, but now I do** ✅

---

## 🧠 Why this exists

Every developer must, at some point, build:

- a TODO app
- a weather app
- a pokédex
- something that uses `useEffect` incorrectly (optional)

This is my contribution to the **TODO App Industrial Complex™**.

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🧪 Tests

- None.
- I tested it by:
  - Opening the app
  - Clicking things
  - Saying “yeah that works”

## 📌 Final Thoughts

This app will not change the world.
But it does prove I can:

- structure a project
- write components
- manage state
- and finally tick off “build a TODO app” from my TODO list

Mission accomplished 🫡
